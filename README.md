# FoodForAll

## [Check it out here!](https://djkean.github.io/FoodForAll/)

Food for All is a "Hunger Games" inspired random battle simulator, where you you can customize a lobby of different foods and cooking utensils for an epic battle royale between your favourite meals! Each round is randomized - Daisy, the fearsome pizza might clash with Frank, the mighty hotdog! Or maybe Bob, the pie will get his just desserts! Create up to 20 players, either randomly or of your choosing and watch and each chaotic round unfurls.

This project was part of my learning experience with [Get Coding](https://www.get-coding.ca).
